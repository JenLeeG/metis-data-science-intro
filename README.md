# Intro to Data Science Using Python with Charles Givre 
## Let's set up your computer!
### Step 1: Install Anaconda.
Anaconda from Continuum Analytics provides virtually everything you need to get started in data science. Go to https://continuum.io/downloads and follow the instructions in the website - they vary per platform.
**Please install the version for Python 3.** 
### Step 2: Install Git (optional)
You'll need a command line prompt to launch Anaconda's Jupyter Notebooks for this lesson. We recommend Git in case you're interested in version control or cloud deployment in the future. Go to http://git-scm.com/downloads and follow the directions there.
### Step 3: Starting Jupyter Notebook
We're going to use Jupyter, formerly known as IPython, which is short for “Interactive Python.” This is a way for you to code within a browser in a faster, interactive way.
* Open your terminal prompt and type `git clone https://github.com/cgivre/metis-data-science-intro`.  This will copy the contents of this repository onto your machine.
* Navigate to your working directory
* Type `jupyter notebook` into the prompt
* Some computation should happen...
* Go to your browser and type in this URL: http://localhost:8888/ (this may launch anyway)
If you see a new browser tab pop up, create a "New" notebook in the top right corner. Let's get started!
